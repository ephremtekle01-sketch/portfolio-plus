Portfolio-Plus is a modern, clean, and fully responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS.
It showcases my work, skills, projects, and contact details in a simple, elegant, and user-friendly layout.
This project is designed with a section-based structure (hero, about, skills, projects, contact) — each section is placed in its own folder for better organization and scalability.
